# DBT SPICE

### Introduction

The aim of this repository is both to provide tools for **Heavy crunching data** (deep statistical analyses, Machine Learning methods refactored to DBT Jinja SQL, etc) and **Big Data best practices** with DBT (cleaners to run be triggered to maintain your datasets unpolluted, metadata crawlers for BigQuery, etc).

I am going to be focused on GCP work with BigQuery.

If there is a specific functionality that you would like to cover with DBT, contact me
```
Support to the mission & PRs are also accepted.

Maybe one day this can be turned into a DBT package to install.


### Development
