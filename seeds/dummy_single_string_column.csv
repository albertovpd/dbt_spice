"I really really wanted to like this product but honestly it's just not what i expected. The performance is ok but not great, and i had to restart it several times. several times! also the manual was missing and i had to google stuff, which is not ideal. i wouldn't buy it again unless it's heavily discounted."
the delivery was fast but that’s about it. it works... kind of? i used it for a couple weeks and it started acting weird. rebooting helped once or twice but eventually nothing worked. i kept trying because i read good reviews but mine must be faulty. really disappointed. support didn’t help much either.
"so i’ve been using this for like a month now and honestly it’s a mixed bag. sometimes it works smoothly, but then sometimes it just freezes for no reason. i updated the firmware and that helped a bit, but not entirely. i talked to a friend who had similar problems. i feel like it could be good, but not yet."
"not worth it. I tried and tried and tried again to get it to work. followed the steps, re-read the setup instructions, even watched videos. nothing helped. The same problem kept happening. repeating the same steps hoping for different results... frustrating. wish i'd picked something else."
